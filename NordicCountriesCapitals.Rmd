This Markdown document shows a map of the nordic countries and their capitals.
The size of the capital marker is showing the number of residents in the country.

## `r Sys.Date()`

```{r echo=FALSE}
dfNordic <- data.frame(
  lat = c(59.3333333, 55.676098, 60.192059, 59.911491,64.13548),
  lng = c(18.05, 12.568337, 24.945831, 10.757933, -21.89541 ),
  Country = c("Sweden", "Denmark", "Finland", "Norway", "Iceland"),
  Capital= c("Stockholm","Copenhagen","Helsinki", "Oslo", "Reykjavik"),
  Residents = c(9747355, 5659715,5474094, 5165802,325671))
  
```

Showing map

```{r}
library(leaflet)
dfNordic %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(weight = 1, radius = sqrt(dfNordic$Residents) * 30)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
